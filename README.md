# Multimodal Voxel-Based Analysis using Non-Parametric Combination

This repository contains the pre-processing and analysis codes used in the work by Isen et al. titled "Non-Parametric Combination of Multimodal MRI for Lesion Detection in MRI-Negative Focal Epilepsy".

## Introduction

One third of patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy have normal-appearing MRI scans. This poses a problem, as identification of the epileptogenic region is required to consider surgical treatment. In Isen et al., we performed a multimodal voxel-based analysis (VBA) to identify brain abnormalities in MRI-negative focal epilepsy. Using the non-parametric combination algorithm, we combined data from various MR sequences to form a joint inference from a multivariate dataset.

## Requirements

This work was implemented as a set of MATLAB and bash routines, which can be carried out within an MATLAB environment.
